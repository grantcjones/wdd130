      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>When was the last time that the words 'convenient' and 'adventure' came out of your mouth in the same sentence? Never? I didn't think so. That's why I do what I do - whatever your adventure is, I work to remove obstacles by creating and maintaining attractive websites and online storefronts as a gateway to adventure, not bothersome hoops to jump through to find fun. I do this for many businesses to ensure a smooth business-to-customer-experience.</p>  <!-- change this -->
      

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My audience will be those seeking to attract and serve clientele through their websites and applications. They need these two essential things for their business to thrive. With my expertise, I will create websites and other applications that are stunning enough to catch the eye and garner visual appreciation from viewers. Then, when they have noticed my audience, they will be looking to use the website or application. If it doesn’t work, if it doesn’t even feel like a smooth experience, my audience can and will lose potential and current business. It’s my job to ensure that everything works to satisfaction.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        People will be coming to my site because it is visually appealing, easy to use, and overall, a great experience in using it. 
        This is important because these people will want this for their websites so they can increase their customer base and, ultimately, 
        their revenue. A good-working website is an important investment and asset in today’s world, and with a terrible website, or worse, no 
        website, almost any business will be doomed to fail. It is my website’s purpose to show how that unthinkable outcome can be avoided. 
        My homepage will grab attention, promote the website’s image, and, as by design, will help clients decide that working with us is the 
        best option to promote their business, help customers, and increase revenue through their website on the internet. For those not in the 
        business world, either wishing to have a persuasive or informative presence on the World Wide Web, will find that through StickWeb their 
        ideas and information will reach the ears, and specifically, eyes, of their target audience.

      </ul>
      <h3>The How: Getting Started</h3>
      <p>
        2.	Our clients will want to start the process of planning their website through StickWeb. We provide intuitive, easy to use tools to get the
        idea, and, very specifically, the vision of their new or improved website planned out. They will start with a variety of options, beginning 
        with their desire for the website, namely Business Matters, The Spreading of Information, or the Persuading of Readers. Then our client will 
        have the options of generalized wireframes, and those wireframes can be either changed to the client’s liking or can stay as is! Of course, we will 
        provide plenty of information along the way that will gently and informatively explain the process. Then comes the pretty part. Our viewers will be 
        able to choose the color palettes for their website! There will be pre-built color palettes that will have recommendations for certain visual goals. 
        For example, it’s been proven that the colors red and yellow invoke hunger, so a client wishing to create a website for a restaurant would be suited 
        to a palette that involves such colors. But, if the client decides they want to choose their own colors, the sky’s the limit for their customization! 
        (That and the number of colors in a palette will have a maximum). Then when these options are all chosen out, the client can submit a request for a 
        consultation to begin the process of creating their all-new website! Whatever the case, we must have their vision present to bring it to life. Then, 
        they must have an idea of what they want their viewers to think of them. Will they have a bold, daringly designed website to provoke the viewers’ 
        senses and draw them in? Do they want viewers to see them as professional and clean cut, or maybe even fun and exciting? This goal is important, as it 
        helps affect the way that their viewers will see and feel about them.

      </ul>
      <h3>The Why</h3>
      <p>
        3.	Our visitors will first need to know why they need a website. StickWeb will be an example to them of what an online presence should look like to 
        not only draw a crowd, but draw in new viewers and for businesses, revenue. Then, they must know what they wish to accomplish with their website. Are 
        they trying to increase sales, or even improve their ability to provide services to their customers? Or are they trying to get the word out on important 
        news, such as scientific discoveries, or even events in the world at large? Or do they wish to persuade their viewers,such as through a political party? 
        It may be that they feel passionately about something and wish for others to find that passion.
