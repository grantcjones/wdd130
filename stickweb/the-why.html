                <p>The world has changed so much over the last three decades. We've made incredible leaps that those before us didn't even think were possible. And yet here we are. Now, with the power of the World-Wide-Web, we have access to almost all the information and tools we could ever ask for. Inversely, this also means that you now have the power to reach out farther than the door of your home or business - you have the power to reach the world. That's where having a website comes in.</p>

                <h2>Growing a business without a website is almost unheard of nowadays, and it's not hard to see why. How else would we at StickWeb have been able to reach you? Certainly not by walking up to your door. A website is an excellent gateway to giving access to new and existing clients and partners, all through the influence of the internet.</h2>

                <h2>So you have an idea or goal you want to share. You, and maybe even some of your associates feel so passionate about it that you want to share it. Sure, you can go face-to-face to talk to people about it, and you should. This is something important to you! But how many people can you hold a conversation with at once? That's the importance of placing an idea in a website - it carries whatever you're passoinate about right into the hands of the world.</h2>

They have to know, how could they not know about the specific thing that you've found? Then place that information right were people look for it - their phones, computers, or anything else that they use to access the internet. Pass the power of knowledge to the world through a new website.</h2>
