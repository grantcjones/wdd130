    <h2>AKA Jonesy</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Grant Jones. I'm occasionally called Jonesy.
        My dream career is to be a Software Engineer. I eventually want to start and run my own business.
        I enjoy playing video games with my friends, talking with family, and country dancing with my wife. 
        We're expecting a baby girl at the end of June, which we're particularly excited for.
        Like I said, I eventually want to run a business. I'd love to do something along the lines of User 
        Experience (basically coding websites and apps to be more user friendly).
        I've loved studying here at BYU-Idaho because I feel free to explore my interests and I receive so much
        support and advice in my decision making from staff and colleagues alike. One of the reasons I'm really 
        excited to take this course is my best friend works at his Uncle's plane detailing business and is planning on 
        buying it from him eventually, and he's given me a soft offer to manage their website once I learn how, so I 
        have a potential client right from the get-go.
